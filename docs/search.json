      "contents": "\nMacro Resources\nOur World in Data: Good for visualizing long term data like population trends, growth, debt, poverty, taxation, etc… Go to ourworldindata.org and check for example population growth data, debt over gdp by country or trade and globalization data for the whole world.\nIMF Data Portal: data.imf.org. You can access World Economic Outlook Database (here is the April 2025 version), where you can do analysis of countries, groups or download the whole database.\nFRED: the St. Louis Fred site has a lot of historical data, mainly from the US and also mainly about prices like interest rates, inflation, etc… Visit https://fred.stlouisfed.org\nIndex Of Economic Freedom: this classifies countries by rule of law, market openness, etc… Countries with greater freedom do better in the long run. You can visualize the evolution and compare between countries and their freedom components here\nValuation Resources\nResearch Affiliates. They have the Asset Allocation Interactive Tool here, where you can see current valuations and historical references. Go to https://www.researchaffiliates.com and subscribe, it’s free.\nCAPE Valuations: country valuations using the CAPE ratio, produced by Barclays. It is hidden, but go to this link to see this data.\nGurufocus (freemium): good data for specific companies, some data is paid. Go to https://www.gurufocus.com\nBacktesting and prices\nPortfolio Visualizer. has the best data quality, and great asset allocation tools (very powerful). Free data goes just up to 2008. Paid goes up to 1970, and you can upload your own. It does inflation adjusted data, etc… Go to https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com, or the legacy interface at https://legacy.portfoliovisualizer.com which I prefer.\nOpenBB. Tries to be a Bloomberg clone and looks very promising. Visit https://openbb.co\nKnowing the market size\nFinViz. Good for understanding the size of the equity market. Go to the ‘Maps’ Menu in this link, where you can see the size of the US, International and ETF markets. It also shows performance, valuations,etc… (always double check since free data sometimes is not reliable). Go to finviz.com\nMSCI World Index site. This index tries to cover most of the investable equities in the world by free float. Go to the site here and check the factsheets (like this one): it will show you weights by country and industry.\n\n\n\n\n",
